methodology: To establish this list, CSIS first conducted a literature review, looking for the frequency that individual reforms were listed by business associations, prominent economists, and government agencies. To refine the list, CSIS organized a series of workshops featuring experts from outside the Indian government who further refined the list and helped determine the difficulty of enacting. Feedback is welcome.
