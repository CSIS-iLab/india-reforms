methodology_title: Methodology
methodology: To establish this list, CSIS first conducted a literature review, looking
  for the frequency that individual reforms were listed by business associations,
  prominent economists, and government agencies. To refine the list, CSIS conducted
  a robust survey of over 50 prominent economists, policymakers, and experts. CSIS
  also organized a series of workshops in Washington D.C. and New Delhi featuring
  experts from outside the Indian government who further refined the list and helped
  determine the difficulty of enacting. Feedback is welcome.
