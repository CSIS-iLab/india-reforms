    <p>India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Domestic economic reforms aimed at improving the business environment are key for further accelerating India's economic growth and making the country competitive vis-a-vis other global players.</p>

    <p>Some reforms can impact multiple industries simultaneously. Others are more targeted but focus on sectors critical for job creation and growth.</p>

    <p>Through the India Reforms Scorecard 3.0, the CSIS India Chair presents a wish list of thirty reforms that the newly elected government should address. The list has been collated after rigorous literature reviews, surveys, and brainstorming sessions involving scholars, economists, and industry leaders. While such a list can never be definitive, we hope this list helps the public understand the choices that are on the table and track the pace of progress on individual reform items.</p>

   <p>This scorecard will be updated on a regular basis as we see tangible progress on individual reforms.
