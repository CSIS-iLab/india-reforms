          Pundits sometimes act as if “economic reforms” are a light switch that India’s central government can turn on and off. In reality, the process of reforming the economy is nuanced, involving a diverse set of issues and actors. The following scorecard is a list of thirty big reforms that the Modi government confronted when it took office, and the status of each. Such a list can never be absolutely definitive, and <a href="#feedback-form">we welcome the feedback of others</a>. We hope this list helps the public understand the choices that are on the table, and that each reform will move at an independent pace. This scorecard will be updated on a monthly basis as we see tangible progress on individual reforms.
