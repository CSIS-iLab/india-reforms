            <strong>Methodology:</strong>To establish this list, CSIS first
            conducted a literature review, looking for the frequency that
            individual reforms were listed by business associations, prominent
            economists, and government agencies. To refine the list, CSIS
            organized a series of workshops featuring experts from outside the
            Indian government who further refined the list and helped determine
            the difficulty of enacting. Feedback is welcome.
