## What's Included

  - service worker
  - hot reloading
  - es6 features
  - async/await
  - spread operators
  - imports
  - and [more](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- React Snapshot is a zero-configureation pre-renderer that creates static html. This is better SEO for crawlers like Google and Web Archive.
- Polyfills for older browsers used by our global audience:
  - @babel/polyfill
  - react-app-polyfill
- Create React App Rewired's config-overrides.js allows the use of other style utilities in order to conform with other CSIS projects:
  - [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
  - [postcss](http://postcss.org/)
  - [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)
  - [sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader)

- To parse markdown
  - [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter)
  - [raw-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/raw-loader)
- To bypass cors issues, a proxy server and lambda functions serve a resource when `"/.netlify/functions/cors/"` is added as a prefix in fetch:
  - [netlify-lambda](https://github.com/netlify/create-react-app-lambda)
  - [http-proxy-middleware](https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware)
