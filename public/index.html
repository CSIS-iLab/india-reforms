      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.

      "description" : "Pundits sometimes act as if “economic reforms” are a light switch that India’s central government can turn on and off. In reality, the process of reforming the economy is nuanced, involving a diverse set of issues and actors. The following scorecard is a list of thirty big reforms that the Modi government confronted when it took office, and the status of each. Such a list can never be absolutely definitive, and we welcome the feedback of others. We hope this list helps the public understand the choices that are on the table, and that each reform will move at an independent pace. This scorecard will be updated on a monthly basis as we see tangible progress on individual reforms."
